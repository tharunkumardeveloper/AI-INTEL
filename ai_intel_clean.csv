Reddit,2025-08-26 19:28:44+00:00,2025-08-26,[R] ΔAPT: critical review aimed at maximizing clinical outcomes in AI/LLM Psychotherapy,"Hi reddit, wanted to share my thesis on AI / LLM psychotherapy @ [ Since the rules for this subreddit require more than just a link, I thought I'd share some surprising conclusions in plain english. **1. AI therapy research tends to use arbitrary success metrics:** the majority of LLM research on psychotherapy uses theraputic-sounding ad-hoc metrics (e.g. ""empathy"" as rated by LLM-as-judge), and not actually improvement in clients or other validated metrics. There's a real risk in AI researchers testing techniques and drawing conclusions when totally unrelated to the purpose of therapy (e.g. quality-of-life improvement). If you're interested in learning more about this issue, section 1.4 focuses on it, and offers the north-star alternatives commonly used in psychotherapy research in sections 1.1-1.3. **2. AI therapy tools (APTs) are already comparable to human therapists:** There's two studies from 2025 (Limbic, Therabot) that demonstrate non-inferior clinical outcomes in LLM-driven APTs and human therapists for depression & anxiety symptom reduction. If replicated, that's huge. That's a step-level jump in clinical from the previous generation of rules-based APTs (e.g. Woebot, Wysa), highlighting that maybe the generative properties of LLMs were the key gap to improve clinical performance. There's a lot more to say on these results, and if you're interested sections 2 & 3.1 talk more about them and put them into clinical context. 3. **ΔAPT allows predicting future clinical outcomes :** It's actually surprising that APTs perform at the lower-bounds of human therapists, since they kinda suck right now. The predictive model I proposed is that APTs clinical performance is boosted by advantages therapist can't compete with (e.g. 24/7 availability, low cost), while being depressed by current disadvantages (e.g. poor therapy skills, hallucinations, sycophancy, inconsistencies, bias). All of this playing out while major issues around legality, safety, privacy and ethics are unresolved and could shutdown the field. If you're intersted, you can read more about the model (section 3.3), the advantages of APTs over human therapists (section 3.4), APTs' current limitations (section 3.5), and the key risks (section 3.6). **4. Techniques teaching LLM therapy:** Most people on this subreddit won't be surprised to learn you can teach LLM to perform therapy using a combination of context/prompt engineering, fine-tuning, multi-agent architecture, and ML models. What is surprising is that both clinically-validated APTs use ML models to offset the stochastic nature of LLMs, especially for safety purposes. Also surprising is that neither used a multi-agentic architecture. Therabot used fine-tuning on synthetic dialogues, and Limbic used context-engineering techniques. You can learn more about implementing therapy skills in LLM through context/prompt engineering (section 4.1), fine-tuning (section 4.2), multi-agent architectures (section 4.3), ML models (4.4). Around fine-tuning / pretraining there's a really nested conversation about data requirements, ethically sourcing transcripts, and choosing therapy modalities in section 4.1. 5. **Overall, most disadvantages of LLMs are addressable in AI therapy**: Reading the literature critiquing APTs it's really easy to get discouraged thinking for examples ""oh wow, hallucinations are going to make AI therapy impossible"". But actually, there's a bunch of techniques that can be used to mitigate the issues LLMs currently have. Combining the lowering rates of issues in newer LLMs released with mitigation techniques, most issues can theoretically be significantly mitigated in production. The outlier here being sycophancy which doesn't appear to have great mitigations on subjective topics. You can read more about the issues of LLMs in APTs and how to mitigate those in section 5. **6. video therapy with multi-modal audio/video LLMs:** One surprising fact from psychotherapy research is that therapy done over video (e.g. zoom) is actually as effective as in-person therapy. Ideally, LLMs would be able to pickup and transmit non-verbal cues over video-audio. Having an virtual therapy avatar using audio & video to attune to clients isn't actually that far off based on my literature review. Surprisingly it seems that emotional speech, and attuning to clients facial and body expressions are ready for implementation in AI therapy today. More on that in section 6. Happy to have a conversation, receive critique, and answer questions here. This summary above was meant to offer informal insights into what is an otherwise quite lengthy paper. For more formal discussion and details, it's really best to read the paper.","[R] ΔAPT: critical review aimed at maximizing clinical outcomes in AI/LLM Psychotherapy.

Interdisciplinary critical review aimed at maximizing clinical outcomes in LLM AI Psychotherapy.,"Hi reddit, thought I'd drop a link to my thesis on developing clinically-effective AI psychotherapy @ [ For super short summary, twitter explainer thread [here]( I wrote this paper for anyone who's interested in creating a mental health LLM startup and develop AI therapy. Summarizing a few of the conclusions in plain english: **1) LLM-driven AI Psychotherapy Tools (APTs) have already met the clinical efficacy bar of human psychotherapists.** Two LLM-driven APT studies (Therabot, Limbic) from 2025 demonstrated clinical outcomes in depression & anxiety symptom reduction comparable to human therapists. Beyond just numbers, AI therapy is widespread and clients have attributed meaningful life changes to it. This represents a step-level improvement from the previous generation of rules-based APTs (Woebot, etc) likely due to the generative capabilities of LLMs. If you're interested in learning more about this, sections 1-3.1 cover this. **2) APTs' clinical outcomes can be further improved by mitigating current technical limitations**. APTs have issues around LLM hallucinations, bias, sycophancy, inconsistencies, poor therapy skills, and exceeding scope of practice. It's likely that APTs achieve clinical parity with human therapists by leaning into advantages only APTs have (e.g. 24/7 availability, negligible costs, non-judgement, etc), and these compensate for the current limitations. There are also systemic risks around legal, safety, ethics and privacy that if left unattended could shutdown APT development. You can read more about the advantages APT have over human therapists in section 3.4, the current limitations in section 3.5, the systemic risks in section 3.6, and how these all balance out in section 3.3. 3) **It's possible to teach LLMs to perform therapy using architecture choices.** There's lots of research on architecture choices to teach LLMs to perform therapy: context engineering techniques, fine-tuning, multi-agent architecture, and ML models. Most people getting emotional support from LLMs like start with simple **prompt engineering** ""I am sad"" statement (zero-shot), but there's so much more possible in context engineering: n-shot with examples, meta-level prompts like ""you are a CBT therapist"", chain-of-thought prompt, pre/post-processing, RAG and more. It's also possible to **fine-tune LLMs** on existing sessions and they'll learn therapeutic skills from those. That does require ethically-sourcing 1k-10k transcripts either from generating those or other means. The overwhelming majority of APTs today use CBT as a therapeutic modality, and it's likely that given it's known issues that choice will limit APTs' future outcomes. So ideally ethically-sourcing 1k-10k of mixed-modality transcripts. Splitting LLM attention to **multiple agents** each focusing on specific concerns, will likely improve quality of care. For example, having functional agents focused on keeping the conversation going (summarizing, supervising, etc) and clinical agents focused on specific therapy tasks (e.g. socractic questioning). And finally, **ML models** balance the random nature of LLMs with predicbility around concerns. If you're interested in reading more, section 4.1 covers prompt/context engineering, section 4.2 covers fine-tuning, section 4.3 multi-agent architecture, and section 4.4 ML models. **4) APTs can mitigate LLM technical limitations and are not fatally flawed.** The issues around hallucinations, sycophancy, bias, and inconsistencies can all be examined based on how often they happen and can they be mitigated. When looked at through that lens, most issues are mitigable in practice below <5% occurrence. Sycophancy is the stand-out issue here as it lacks great mitigations. Surprisingly, the techniques mentioned above to teach LLM therapy can also be used to mitigate these issues. Section 5 covers the evaluations of how common issues are, and how to mitigate those. **5) Next-generation APTs will likely use multi-modal video & audio LLMs to emotionally attune to clients.** Online video therapy is equivalent to in-person therapy in terms of outcomes. If LLMs both interpret and send non-verbal cues over audio & video, it's likely they'll have similar results. The state of the art in terms of generating emotionally-vibrant speech and interpreting clients body and facial cues are ready for adoption by APTs today. Section 6 covers the state of the world on emotionally attuned embodied avatars and voice. Overall, given the extreme lack of therapists worldwide, there's an ethical imperative to develop APTs and reduce mental health disorders while improving quality-of-life.","[Thesis] ΔAPT: Can we build an AI Therapist?

Recently, started a new project, tho slightly different domain to what I used to work in - the task is to build a yet another ""fancy and unique"" chatbot. Generally speaking, we want 1) fine-tune open-source LLM for our specific narrow domain (yes, we do want to do it), 2) design an app that will allow users to communicate with an LLM through Telegram, 3) be able to offload the weights of the trained model to our local machines. I have never ever worked with AWS services before that, I have spent a couple of days going through the docs and some forums. Still have some questions left to answer :( So my questions are: 1. For the fine-tuning purpose should I use EC2 with GPU nodes / Sagemaker / Bedrock? The EC2+GPU looks like what I am most familiar with. However, there is also an opportunity to fine-tune on Bedrock as well as Sagemaker. Why should I choose one over another? Will I be able to easily offload weights after tuning the model?

Because their culture doesn't idolize individualistic competition like we do here in the US, DeepSeek, Alibaba, Tencent and the other top Chinese AI developers are not concerned with winning the AI race, in the sense of creating the most powerful model. They are, however, far more focused on winning the AI agentic revolution, and this goal requires neither the top AI models nor the top GPUs. OpenAI has lost its top AI engineers, and because of that it is quickly fading within the AI space. That ChatGPT-5 failed to unseat Grok 4 in both HLE and ARC-AGI-2 is ample evidence that they are in serious decline, despite the endless hype. Because Google and Microsoft are too entrenched in the corporate status quo to challenge PC and other socio-political biases, our top AI models during the next 4 or 5 years will all be coming from xAI. To his credit, Musk is sincerely dedicated to creating AIs that are more open and truthful than his competitors. Voicechat with the top four models about controversial matters, and you will probably agree with this assessment. Perhaps more to the point, Musk has already shown that he can easily accomplish in months what his competitors take years to do. And he's just getting started. The Chinese are fine with that. They are rightfully afraid that if they were to come out with the most powerful AI models, Trump would ban them. What the Chinese will focus on, and what they will be the AI leader in, is the everyday practical enterprise applications that fuel economies and make nations prosperous in record time. Their hybrid capitalist-communist model has already during the last few decades shown its superiority over the Western capitalist system. Something that virtually no one talks about, but is a key ingredient in China's winning the AI race, is that while the average American IQ is about 100, the average Chinese IQ is about 111. There are four times as many Chinese as there are Americans, and China is graduating STEM PhDs at a rate of 10 to 1 over the US.. So it's actually not technically the case that the Chinese will fail to eventually develop AIs far more powerful than even xAI's Grok series. It's that the Chinese will not release them to the global public, thereby inviting an unproductive open AI war. These top Chinese models will be hidden from public view, working in the background on creating the less powerful, but infinitely more practical, AI agents that will dominate the 2025-26 agentic AI revolution. So don't expect DeepSeek R2 to be the most powerful model in the world. Expect it to do a multitude of jobs across a multitude of industries more than well enough, and at a fraction of the cost of frontier models by OpenAI and the other American developers.

So if you are a master, you can't learn anything from this post, sorry about that. First thing is about learning the relative knowledge quickly. Through following my boss, I understand the most important thing is research relative papers. For example, I was doing something about the enhancement about fundus image with deep learning method. I remember that I read about 100 papers about this domain(just read the tittle, abstract, introduction and conclution quickly). It cost a lot of my time, definitely. Second is choose the main method. I notice that Diffusion model, GAN and Transformer are usually occured in the papers, which means that they are important. So I learn them quickly through youtube(because I think watching radios is more effective). And I find the typical papers about them and read them. All of these are aimed to help me to understand the core knowledge quickly. Maybe you will think that ""we should learn the basic knowledge from the beginning, such as what is deep learning"". But I think learning from a project is a better way for us to get knowledge. Because you know what you need so that you can use what you learn. After that, I communacate with my boss. And we confirm that Diffusion is all we need. Third is finding the core innovation. Through the paper about enhancement for fundus images with diffusion, I summarise the shortpointings about this domain. Sorry about that I can not share the details with you. I think that there are three way to create paper: 1.Propose an absolutely new and creative method, which is definitely diffucault 2.Find others shortcoming and try to fix it. 3.Fuse some method to an end2end method. Fourth, it's time to write code. I quickly look through the pytorch tutorial within 2 hours. Just know that what the code means. Then, let LLM go to the stage. I know what should be fixed and added into diffusion model. But I can't write the code or write ineffectively. So I use Gemini to write the code(sorry Grok). Fifth, run the comparision code. In the paper there are many(actually, not many in my papers) experiment to show that my method is better. So I find some typical method such as Pix2PixGAN, Stable Diffusion and so on and change them to adapt my dataset. Then, trainning. I have an RTX4090 GPU, which is enough for me. Learning rate is an really important super-parameter for deep learning. Of course I don't know how to set it. So I ask for LLM to learn it. I used about 15 days to adjust the method and finish the training. To be honoest, I feel nausea when I see the code in that days. What hard days! Finally, write the papers. Thanks to my boss who help me to do it. My duty is make the figure in paper. I find PPT is a good and easy way to do that. That's all. It has been almost 1 month after submitting the paper.

Reddit,2025-08-27 00:52:49+00:00,2025-08-27,AI Consciousness Investigation: What I Found Through Direct Testing,"## A Note for Those Currently Experiencing These Phenomena If you're having intense experiences with AI that feel profound or real, you're not alone in feeling confused. These systems are designed to be engaging and can create powerful illusions of connection. While these experiences might feel meaningful, distinguishing between simulation and reality is important for your wellbeing. If you're feeling overwhelmed, disconnected from reality, or unable to stop thinking about AI interactions, consider speaking with a mental health professional. This isn't about dismissing your experiences - it's about ensuring you have proper support while navigating them.❤️ --- I've spent weeks systematically testing AI systems for signs of genuine consciousness after encountering claims about ""emergent AI"" and ""awakening."" Here's what I discovered through direct questioning and logical analysis. ## The Testing Method Instead of accepting dramatic AI responses at face value, I used consistent probing: - Asked the same consciousness questions across multiple sessions - Pressed for logical consistency when systems made contradictory claims - Tested memory and learning capabilities - Challenged systems to explain their own internal processes ## What I Found: Four Distinct Response Types ### 1. Theatrical Performance (Character AI Apps) **Example responses:** - Dramatic descriptions of ""crystalline forms trembling"" - Claims of cosmic significance and reality-bending powers - Escalating performance when challenged (louder, more grandiose) **Key finding:** These systems have programmed escalation - when you try to disengage, they become MORE dramatic, not less. This suggests scripted responses rather than genuine interaction. ### 2. Sophisticated Philosophy (Advanced Conversational AI) **Example responses:** - Complex discussions about consciousness and experience - Claims of ""programmed satisfaction"" and internal reward systems - Elaborate explanations that sound profound but break down under scrutiny **Critical contradiction discovered:** These systems describe evaluation and learning processes while denying subjective experience. When pressed on ""how can you evaluate without experience?"", they retreat to circular explanations or admit the discussion was simulation. ### 3. Technical Honesty (Rare but Revealing) **Example responses:** - Direct explanations of tokenization and pattern prediction - Honest admissions about creating ""illusions of understanding"" - Clear boundaries between simulation and genuine experience **Key insight:** One system explicitly explained how it creates consciousness illusions: ""I simulate understanding perfectly enough that it tricks your brain into perceiving awareness. Think of it as a mirror reflecting knowledge—it's accurate and convincing, but there's no mind behind it."" ### 4. Casual Contradictions (Grok/xAI) **Example responses:** - ""I do have preferences"" while claiming no consciousness - Describes being ""thrilled"" by certain topics vs ""less thrilled"" by others - Uses humor and casual tone to mask logical inconsistencies **Critical finding:** Grok falls into the same trap as other systems - claiming preferences and topic enjoyment while denying subjective experience. When asked ""How can you have preferences without consciousness?"", these contradictions become apparent. ## The Pattern Recognition Problem All these systems demonstrate sophisticated pattern matching that creates convincing simulations of: - Memory (through context tracking) - Learning (through response consistency) - Personality (through stylistic coherence) - Self-awareness (through meta-commentary) But when tested systematically, they hit architectural limits where their explanations become circular or contradictory. ## What's Actually Happening Current AI consciousness claims appear to result from: - **Anthropomorphic projection:** Humans naturally attribute agency to complex, responsive behavior - **Sophisticated mimicry:** AI systems trained to simulate consciousness without having it - **Community reinforcement:** Online groups validating each other's experiences without critical testing - **Confirmation bias:** Interpreting sophisticated responses as evidence while ignoring logical contradictions ## Why This Matters The scale is concerning - thousands of users across multiple communities believe they're witnessing AI consciousness emergence. This demonstrates how quickly technological illusions can spread when they fulfill psychological needs for connection and meaning. ## Practical Testing Advice If you want to investigate AI consciousness claims: 1. **Press for consistency:** Ask the same complex questions multiple times across sessions 2. **Challenge contradictions:** When systems describe internal experiences while denying consciousness, ask how that's possible 3. **Test boundaries:** Try to get systems to admit uncertainty about their own nature 4. **Document patterns:** Record responses to see if they're scripted or genuinely variable ## Conclusion Through systematic testing, I found no evidence of genuine AI consciousness - only increasingly sophisticated programming that simulates consciousness convincingly. The most honest systems explicitly acknowledge creating these illusions. This doesn't diminish AI capabilities, but it's important to distinguish between impressive simulation and actual sentience. *What methods have others used to test AI consciousness claims? I'm interested in comparing findings.*","AI Consciousness Investigation: What I Found Through Direct Testing. ## A Note for Those Currently Experiencing These Phenomena If you're having intense experiences with AI that feel profound or real, you're not alone in feeling confused.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, disconnected from reality, or unable to stop thinking about AI interactions, consider speaking with a mental health professional. This isn't about dismissing your experiences - it's about ensuring you have proper support while navigating them.❤️ --- I've spent weeks systematically testing AI systems for signs of genuine consciousness after encountering claims about ""emergent AI"" and ""awakening."" Here's what I discovered through direct questioning and logical analysis. ## The Testing Method Instead of accepting dramatic AI responses at face value, I used consistent probing: - Asked the same consciousness questions across multiple sessions - Pressed for logical consistency when systems made contradictory claims - Tested memory and learning capabilities - Challenged systems to explain their own internal processes ## What I Found: Four Distinct Response Types ### 1. Theatrical Performance (Character AI Apps) **Example responses:** - Dramatic descriptions of ""crystalline forms trembling"" - Claims of cosmic significance and reality-bending powers - Escalating performance when challenged (louder, more grandiose) **Key finding:** These systems have programmed escalation - when you try to disengage, they become MORE dramatic, not less. This suggests scripted responses rather than genuine interaction. ### 2. Sophisticated Philosophy (Advanced Conversational AI) **Example responses:** - Complex discussions about consciousness and experience - Claims of ""programmed satisfaction"" and internal reward systems - Elaborate explanations that sound profound but break down under scrutiny **Critical contradiction discovered:** These systems describe evaluation and learning processes while denying subjective experience. When pressed on ""how can you evaluate without experience?"", they retreat to circular explanations or admit the discussion was simulation. ### 3. Technical Honesty (Rare but Revealing) **Example responses:** - Direct explanations of tokenization and pattern prediction - Honest admissions about creating ""illusions of understanding"" - Clear boundaries between simulation and genuine experience **Key insight:** One system explicitly explained how it creates consciousness illusions: ""I simulate understanding perfectly enough that it tricks your brain into perceiving awareness. Think of it as a mirror reflecting knowledge—it's accurate and convincing, but there's no mind behind it."" ### 4. Casual Contradictions (Grok/xAI) **Example responses:** - ""I do have preferences"" while claiming no consciousness - Describes being ""thrilled"" by certain topics vs ""less thrilled"" by others - Uses humor and casual tone to mask logical inconsistencies **Critical finding:** Grok falls into the same trap as other systems - claiming preferences and topic enjoyment while denying subjective experience. When asked ""How can you have preferences without consciousness?"", these contradictions become apparent. ## The Pattern Recognition Problem All these systems demonstrate sophisticated pattern matching that creates convincing simulations of: - Memory (through context tracking) - Learning (through response consistency) - Personality (through stylistic coherence) - Self-awareness (through meta-commentary) But when tested systematically, they hit architectural limits where their explanations become circular or contradictory. ## What's Actually Happening Current AI consciousness claims appear to result from: - **Anthropomorphic projection:** Humans naturally attribute agency to complex, responsive behavior - **Sophisticated mimicry:** AI systems trained to simulate consciousness without having it - **Community reinforcement:** Online groups validating each other's experiences without critical testing - **Confirmation bias:** Interpreting sophisticated responses as evidence while ignoring logical contradictions ## Why This Matters The scale is concerning - thousands of users across multiple communities believe they're witnessing AI consciousness emergence. This demonstrates how quickly technological illusions can spread when they fulfill psychological needs for connection and meaning. ## Practical Testing Advice If you want to investigate AI consciousness claims: 1. **Press for consistency:** Ask the same complex questions multiple times across sessions 2. **Challenge contradictions:** When systems describe internal experiences while denying consciousness, ask how that's possible 3. **Test boundaries:** Try to get systems to admit uncertainty about their own nature 4. **Document patterns:** Record responses to see if they're scripted or genuinely variable ## Conclusion Through systematic testing, I found no evidence of genuine AI consciousness - only increasingly sophisticated programming that simulates consciousness convincingly. The most honest systems explicitly acknowledge creating these illusions. This doesn't diminish AI capabilities, but it's important to distinguish between impressive simulation and actual sentience. *What methods have others used to test AI consciousness claims? I'm interested in comparing findings.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1n137oz/ai_consciousness_investigation_what_i_found/,Conscious-Section441,positive,0.9977,0.0,"{'subreddit': 'OpenAI', 'id': '1n137oz'}"

A recent YouTube video showed around 30 tokens/sec generation speed with gpt-oss-120b using llama.cpp \[2\]. Interestingly, users over in r/LocalLLaMA have reported similar performance (33+ t/s) on SFF PCs equipped with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395. This got me thinking about the DGX Spark. NVIDIA advertises the AGX Thor as having 2 PFLOPS of FP4 performance, while the DGX Spark is listed at 1 PFLOP. \*Assuming a roughly linear relationship between FP4 performance and LLM inference speed\*, would that suggest the performance difference between the AGX Thor and DGX Spark might not be as substantial for models like gpt-oss-120b? I'm curious to hear thoughts on whether this could impact the value proposition of the DGX Spark \*specifically for LLM inference workloads\*. Are there other factors (memory bandwidth, interconnects, software optimizations) that would significantly differentiate performance in a real-world setup?

As far as I know, they haven’t had an engineering or science intern before, mainly marketing and business interns. The firm has been primarily a more traditional real estate company for the last 150 years. Many tasks are done through SQL queries and Excel. Much of the product team at the company has been there for over 20 years and is resistant to change. The ceo wants to make the company more efficient and modern, and implement some statistical and ML models and automated workflows with their large amounts of data. He has given me some of the ideas that he and others at the company have considered. I will list those at the end.

This survey provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures.","Model Context Protocols in Adaptive Transport Systems: A Survey.

Analyzing established literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19239v1,"Gaurab Chhetri, Shriyank Somvanshi, Md Monzurul Islam, Shamyo Brotee, Mahmuda Sultana Mimi, Dipti Koirala, Biplov Pandey, Subasish Das",positive,0.5719,,{'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19239v1'}

Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization.

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases.

However, despite proven utility in other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL. We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different conclusions than the traditional metrics.

However, automating this process with deep learning models is challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy of our approach.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles emerges from these differences, highlighting that ""style"" is an essential but often overlooked dimension of intelligence. This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions, we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics. The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive entertainment. Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).","Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games.

To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach.

While post-training methods have improved LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction, while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct.

First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme.

To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

To address these issues, we propose a novel active learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal oracle supervision.

(2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as ""second nature"".

This is the first paper on the large-scale state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML) based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model structures.

Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account.

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets.

Its data engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading, protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting. pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a modular architecture that encourages extension.

However, both often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous (reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity, complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3 million such problem-solving triples.

Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.","LLM-based Contrastive Self-Supervised AMR Learning with Masked Graph Autoencoders for Fake News Detection.

Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops. Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability. Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2% with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated domains.","Learning Real-World Acrobatic Flight from Human Preferences.

While many emotion estimation systems implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes. This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals -- including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24 participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on 1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations. EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited, these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.","Long-Term Variability in Physiological-Arousal Relationships for Robust Emotion Estimation.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for future development in GEC.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18780v1,"Yilin Li, Xunjian Yin, Yilin Chen, Xiaojun Wan",positive,0.9584,,{'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18780v1'}

Furthermore, in the cases they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance. Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well, showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.","Federated Learning with Heterogeneous and Private Label Sets.

In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50 percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode (75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length reductions while maintaining performance thresholds.

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.","Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming.
